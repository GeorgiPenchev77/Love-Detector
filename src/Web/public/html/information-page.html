        <p><strong>About Love Detector:</strong></p>
        <p class="info">
          The Love Detector is a speed dating tool where users can discover the
          potential of a deeper connection based on how their heartbeats react while engaging in fun conversation with each other.
          We start with individually measuring the heartbeats of both users to
          establish a reference point in order to generate more accurate results after the speed date. The
          measurements are made with sensors that are attached to the users
          earlobes. <br /><br /> The system then proceeds to measure the users heartbeats during
          the speed date while they converse based on displayed speed dating questions.
          Throughout the date, heartbeat data is collected. After the speed date is over, the data is analysed based on the variations and ‘spikes’.<br /><br />
          The final match is determined by processing the data in a compatibility algorithm,
          resulting in one of three levels: "Maybe not the best match...", "There is potential for a nice connection here!", or "A high chance of compatibility detected!". <br/><br />
          Note that a high compatibility score does not guarantee a match in terms of a deeper connection, but merely suggests there is potential for future enjoyable engagement between the two users.
